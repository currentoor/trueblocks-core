## chifra chunks

This tool is not yet ready for production use. Please return to this page later.

```[plaintext]
Purpose:
  Manage and investigate chunks and bloom filters.

Usage:
  chifra chunks <mode> [flags] [blocks...] [address...]

Arguments:
  mode - the type of chunk info to retrieve (required)
	One of [ stats | pins | blooms | index | addresses | appearances ]
  blocks - optional list of blocks to intersect with chunk ranges
  addrs - one or more addresses to use with --belongs option (see note)

Flags:
  -c, --check        depends on mode, checks for internal consistency of the data type
  -b, --belongs      checks if the given address appears in the given chunk
  -d, --details      for the --addresses option only, display appearance records as well as address records
  -x, --fmt string   export format, one of [none|json*|txt|csv|api]
  -v, --verbose      enable verbose (increase detail with --log_level)
  -h, --help         display this help screen

Notes:
  - If blocks are provided, only chunks intersecting with those blocks are displayed.
  - Only a single block in a given chunk needs to be supplied for a match.
  - The --belongs option is only available with the addresses or blooms mode.
  - The --belongs option requires both an address and a block identifier.
  - You may only specifiy an address when using the --belongs option.

#### Other Options

All tools accept the following additional flags, although in some cases, they have no meaning.

```[plaintext]
  -v, --version         display the current version of the tool
      --wei             export values in wei (the default)
      --ether           export values in ether
      --dollars         export values in US dollars
      --raw             pass raw RPC data directly from the node with no processing
      --to_file         write the results to a temporary file and return the filename
      --output string   write the results to file 'fn' and return the filename
      --append          for --output command only append to instead of replace contents of file
      --file string     specify multiple sets of command line options in a file
```

*For the `--file string` option, you may place a series of valid command lines in a file using any valid flags. In some cases, this may significantly improve performance. A semi-colon at the start of any line makes it a comment.*
